# Electromagnetics Solver (Work in Progress)

This repository contains a **numerical solver** for electromagnetic wave propagation, developed as a **research and engineering reference implementation**.

The project focuses on building a **clean, interpretable, and performance-aware solver**, starting from fundamental partial differential equations and extending toward full electromagnetic formulations.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress:**  
> The solver is under active development. The current implementation serves as a foundation for more advanced formulations and extensions.

## Project Goals

- Develop a clear and modular numerical solver for wave-related PDEs
- Emphasize physical interpretability and numerical stability
- Provide a clean modern C++ implementation suitable for scientific computing
- Serve as a reference for electromagnetic and wave propagation modeling

## Current Status

✔️ One-dimensional Poisson equation solver using finite differences and Thomas algorithm
✔️ Basic Dirichlet boundary conditions    

Planned next steps include:
- Extension to two-dimensional grids
- Helmholtz equation (frequency-domain formulation)
- Sparse linear solvers and performance considerations
